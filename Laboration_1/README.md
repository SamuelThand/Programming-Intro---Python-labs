# Laboration 1

## Environment & Tools
Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Pycharm 2021.2.1, Python 3.8.10, Git 2.25.1

## Purpose

###Part 1
This assignment aims to help the student understand the different data types in python, and how they can be assigned. 
Notable is understanding that B = '8' assigns the character 8 as a string
and not as an integer, casting via constructor functions, for example int() and that different data types cannot be arithmetically added together.

### Part 2
This assignment aims to help the student understand What a substring is, basic conditional execution with the if/else
statement, how to use the in operator to check if a string contains a substring
and using the boolean True/False return value for conditional execution.

##Procedures

### Part 1 
The solution can be reproduced by casting the values of variables B and C as integers using the int()
function, adding the values of variables A, B and C using the + addition operator and assigning the sum of the values to the TOTAL variable using the = assignment 
operator.

### Part 2
The solution can be reproduced by determining if the value of str(TOTAL) is a substring in the TEXT variable using
a compound statement containing the if and in operator. Conditionally assign either value "true that" or "nope" to the OUTPUT variable
depending on the return value of True/False from the compound statement. Do this
by nesting the assignment statement under the if and else operators.

### Problems

Problems arose regarding confusion about single and double quotes in the
assignment statements. In Part 2 I was confused if 'TEXT' meant "The text
TEXT as a string" or the variable TEXT. I was also confused about
"the value of 'TOTAL' " - Does it mean the string value 'TOTAL' or 
the previously set value of the variable 'TOTAL'. 

These problems were resolved by trial and error, using different code.

## Discussion

### Perspective

I think the purpose has been fulfilled. The assignment prompted further
research and using the tools we have read about in the course material.

I think the implementation was suitable, and at this moment I don't think
an alternative approach is to be considered. 

###Personal reflections
I think the problems described in 3.3 are related to the new working environment which
I am not used to. Questions like "Can I test my code inside this exercise
or should I make a separate file to run my tests?" arose, but were addressed
once I saw that the assignment was easily testable in the same file.

Because of experiencing a bit of an information overload in the start of
the two current courses, some documentation has admittedly been skimmed.

I am sure many of these issues can be resolved from closely examining 
the documentation. If you like, feel free to guide me to some of this
documentation in your review of this exercise.
